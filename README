### Building the package
The code is written in `go` (version go1.10.4 linux/amd64). To build the package

```
cd bf
go build

cd bbf
go build
```

The benchmarks were run on a 64 bit machine running ubuntu using the WSL. To run the benchmarks locally

```
bf runtests
bbf runtests
```

The kmer strings were generated using the python code 

```
python kmer-generator.py
```

The kmers were randomly shuffled around using
(was taken from https://stackoverflow.com/a/2153889)
```
 cat kmer.txt | awk 'BEGIN{srand();}{print rand()"\t"$0}' | sort -k1 -n | cut -f2- > kmer.shuf
```
